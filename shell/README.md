# Shell

*Originally completed on September - December 2019*

## Task
Using the system call wrapper `execvp`, implement a mini Linux shell that can interpret and execute commands. Other shell functionalities are not required, e.g., running multiple commands in one line, redirection, pipes between commands, shell environment variable, etc. Assume that no command lines will exceed 1000 bytes, including newline and null characters.
Check `shell.c` for more details on implementation.
