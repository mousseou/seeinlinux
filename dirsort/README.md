# Dirsort

*Originally completed on September - December 2019*

## Task
Given a directory, sort all the files in that directory (in ascending order), and in those subdirectories, etc - by file size.

`dirsort_r.c` is a solution that uses recursion.
`dirsort_nr.c` is a solution that does not use recursion.
Check each file for further details on their approach.
