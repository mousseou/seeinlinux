- [Envsort](envsort/), a C program that sorts all environment variables by name as a `name=value` list
- [Radixint](radixint/), a C program that sorts a list of integers via radix sort of base 16
- [Puzzle-15](puzzle/), a C program that given an initial state for a 16-tile board will find the path to a goal state using State Space Search and A* search algorithm
- [Radixfloat](radixfloat/), a C program that memory maps a file containing a list of floating point values and sorts the binary data via radix sort of base 2
- [Dirsort](dirsort/), a nonrecursive and a recursive approach to a C program that will sort a given directories files (and their subdirectories and so on) by file size
