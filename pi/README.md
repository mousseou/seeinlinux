# PI

*Originally completed on September - December 2019*

## Task
Given the number of processes, and the digits to approximate to, use multiple processes to perform the approximation, using pipes as an IPC mechanism.
Check `pi.c` for more details, and how I was able to support both even and odd number of processes.
